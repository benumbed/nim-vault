# nim-vault
Light wrapper around the [HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com/) [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) API.  The library is currently tested against the latest version of the [official Vault Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault).

**NOTE**: This library is a work in-progress, the supported endpoints are expanding regularly. Any Enterprise-level API calls will be provided as procs, but these procs will not be tested due to not having an Enterprise licensed server to test against.

## Documentation
Currently you'll need to take a look at the modules in nim_vault/src/nim_vault/bare.  Generated docs from the source are coming *Real Soon Now* (TM).
